# Frontend

Because it is a single-page application, Chime utilizes React.js and follows the Flux architecture to deliver the frontend application.

Webpack conveniently bundles all of the frontend components and Flux parts.

jQuery is only used to make API calls with the Rails server.

Site layout and styling are done with Bootstrap and Sass. React Bootstrap expedited the building out of the React components that utilized Bootstrap.

Other frontend dependencies are:

- React DOM
- React Router
- React History
- React Linked State Mixin
- Keymirror
- Babel (for JSX)
